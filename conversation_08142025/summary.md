## Main Points:

1.  **Search Preference:** The user's preference to use DuckDuckGo (`ddg`) for web searches was confirmed to be already set in the `gemini_preferences.toml` file.

2.  **Slack MCP Inquiry:** The `askgordon` command was used to inquire about the existence of a Docker MCP for Slack. Gordon's response was not conclusive.

3.  **DuckDuckGo Search:** A DuckDuckGo search was performed to find information about Docker MCPs for Slack. The search yielded several relevant results, including Docker Hub images and GitHub repositories.

4.  **New Slash Command:** A new slash command, `send_slack_report`, was created to enable sending reports to a Slack channel via a Slack MCP. This involved:
    *   Creating a new Python script, `slack_mcp_sender.py`, to handle the interaction with the Slack MCP.
    *   Creating a new command definition file, `send_slack_report.toml`, in the `.gemini/commands/` directory.
