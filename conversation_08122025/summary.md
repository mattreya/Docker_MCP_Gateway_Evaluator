This project appears to be a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) or bot application, possibly integrated with Gemini.

Key components and their likely functions:
*   `mcp_commands.py` and `slash_commands.py`: Likely implement core commands or functionalities for the bot/CLI.
*   `scraper.py`: Suggests web scraping capabilities, possibly to gather data for the commands.
*   `NIST_guildlines.md`: Indicates adherence to NIST guidelines, implying a focus on security or specific standards.
*   `.gemini/commands/`: Contains TOML configuration files for various commands (e.g., `askgordon.toml`, `nist.toml`), suggesting a modular command structure and integration with Gemini's command system.
*   `libs/duckduckgo_mcp_interface`: Points to a custom library for interacting with DuckDuckGo and an "MCP" (possibly "Multi-Channel Platform" or a specific internal system) interface.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.
*   `conversation_08122025/`: A directory for storing conversation logs or task-related data.

The project seems to be a tool designed to perform various tasks, potentially involving data retrieval (scraping), adherence to security guidelines (NIST), and integration with external services (DuckDuckGo), all managed through a command-line or bot interface.
