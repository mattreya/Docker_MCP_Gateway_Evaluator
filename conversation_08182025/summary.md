# Conversation Summary - August 18, 2025

This conversation focused on exploring "Model Context Protocol (MCP)" in the context of AWS tools and improving the `ddg` search functionality.

## Key Actions and Outcomes:

1.  **Asked Gordon about MCP for AWS tools:**
    *   **Query:** "an MCP that connects to AWS tools."
    *   **Gordon's Response:** Defined MCP as "Model Context Protocol," a standard for AI agents to interact with external systems and tools, but did not provide specific AWS-related details.

2.  **Attempted MCP Catalog Lookup for AWS tools:**
    *   **Query:** "AWS tools"
    *   **Outcome:** No results were returned from the `mcp_catalog_lookup` tool.

3.  **Updated `ddg` tool to accept search queries:**
    *   **Problem:** Initially, the `ddg` tool was hardcoded to search for "Python programming" and did not accept user-defined queries.
    *   **Action:** Modified `/home/matt/PycharmProjects/Docker_MCP_Gateway_Evaluator/.gemini/commands/ddg.toml` to include a `{query}` placeholder in its command definition. This involved a robust manual string replacement due to complex escaping issues with the `replace` tool.
    *   **Note:** Informed the user that the underlying Python script (`slash_commands.py`) would also need to be updated to fully utilize the passed query.

4.  **Successfully used `ddg` for "MCP for AWS tools":**
    *   **Query:** "MCP for AWS tools"
    *   **Outcome:** The `ddg` tool successfully executed the search and returned relevant results from DuckDuckGo, including links to AWS blogs, GitHub repositories, and documentation related to Model Context Protocol (MCP) and AWS. This confirmed the successful update of the `ddg` tool's configuration.
